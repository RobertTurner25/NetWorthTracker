I need you to take the python script investments_growth.py and update it to use streamlit for a basic user interface
for showing daily growth of my assets, include a chart to show growth. I need to be able to host this script + UI on a free cloud hosting platform so I can access from my phone. I would also like the feature to be able to edit the spreadsheet through the app through an easy interface, it doesn't have to be a spreadsheet style interface but just need to be able to add an account/ investment and a balance, along with being able to edit a pre existing row from the spreadsheet to update amount of shares or bank balance.
